=== What it is ===
This project is a combinaton of a file serving web server and a rest api.
It serves both json data from power supplies and led (not implemented) and
a basic web interface that demos how everything to use the api

=== How it all works ===
The file main.py starts both the rest api and web server on the port 5049
(configurable in config.json). On startup a thread is started for every power 
supply as well as one for listening for socket connections and one for 
controlling the leds. Once a connection gets established another thread gets
created. This new thread is responsible for handling the new request, it 
parses the http header and body and decides what to do with the request. 
If the request is for the static web page, the required documents are returned
otherwise is the request appended to one of the multiple power supply/led threads
work queue and eventually a result from the thread is converted to json and
returned via http to the requester. 

=== The structure of the api === 
A few things must be cleared up before showing the api tree
	1. If you request an object that is not at the end of a branch it will 
		return an object with all the subobjects in it. 
	2. The current currently delivered by the power supply is located 
		in the api/v1/dev/<no>/status/status object. 
	3. A pw is required for setting data in the power supply, this is to 
		prevent automatic scrips controlling a power supply it should not.
