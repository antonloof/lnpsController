=== What it is ===
This project is a combinaton of a file serving web server and a rest api.
It serves both json data from power supplies and led (not implemented) and
a basic web interface that demos how everything to use the api

=== How it all works ===
The file main.py starts both the rest api and web server on the port 5049
(configurable in config.json). On startup a thread is started for every power 
supply as well as one for listening for socket connections and one for 
controlling the leds. Once a connection gets established another thread gets
created. This new thread is responsible for handling the new request, it 
parses the http header and body and decides what to do with the request. 
If the request is for the static web page, the required documents are returned
otherwise is the request appended to one of the multiple power supply/led threads
work queue and eventually a result from the thead is converted to json and
returnt via http to the requester.
